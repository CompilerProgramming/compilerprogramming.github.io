Compiler Books
==============

I have owned a bunch of compiler books that I have purchased over the years.

Dragon Books
============
I have 3 editions of these. 

* Principles of Compiler Design. Aho & Ullman, 1977.
* Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools. Aho, Sethi, Ullman, 1986.
* Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools, 2nd Ed. Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman, 2006.

These books are criticised today because of the excessive focus on lexical analysis and parsing techniques.
While this is true, they do cover various aspects of the compiler such as intermediate representation and
optimization techniques such as peephole optimzation,  data flow analysis, register allocation etc.

The 2nd edition adopts a more mathematical presentation style, whereas the earlier editions present
algorithms using pseudo code. I think the 1986 edition is the best.

For a different take on 2nd edition see `Review of the second addition of the "Dragon Book" <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Review_of_the_second_addition_of_the_Dragon_Book.>`_.
